# HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript Animation Template

This is essentially the template I use to make animations [such as this](https://fotino.me/static/art2/).

## My Workflow

1. Create a folder for the new animation and `cd` into it.
2. Clone this repository into the new repository with `git clone`.
3. Start a local webserver in the working directory with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000`.
4. Open a new browser tab and navigate to `localhost:9000`.
5. Edit the sections labeled TODO in `index.html` and `index.js`.
6. Save changes and refresh the browser. If more changes needed, go back to step 5.
